Online Textbook Database
========================

**The Online Textbook Database stores one-click links to your online textbooks. [http://otd.io/](http://otd.io/)**

Publishers make it hard to get to the online versions of their textbooks. You usually end up with a mess of links, access codes, usernames, passwords, and a bunch of other things that are hard to use and easy to lose. There's always a million different ways to get to the same book!

**Clicking on an OTD link brings you straight to the first page.** I know some people who lug their books home every day because they can't access their online copy.
